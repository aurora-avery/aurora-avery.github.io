>  I want to write a simple single reason behind why I decided that Software Engineering was engaging enough for me to pursue for my long term future. However I would be lying if I told you I had a easy, quick answer to that question. I believe that in order for anyone to pursue something as a long-term goal without any short-term rewards there has to be natural passion in that field of study/work for them that they were born with. I feel a rush of excitement and some nervousness when I first began trying to code. You see, I grew up with my father who entered the field of tech as his field of study as well. So I had my first computer at a younger age than the rest of my peers. (*and trust me they were not happy about it*) I grew up in a household already teaching me to be excited about computers, the only trick was to find out what exactly it was about them I personally thought was the coolest - in lamest terms I had to find what made me geek out the most. About a year ago while LAN gaming at a friends house, his uncle stopped by and introduced himself to me. He commented on the game we were playing, as he was a fan of it himself. After a while to be friendly I asked what he does on his day to day, and he replied "I'm a Fullstack Developer". I had no idea what that meant, but for whatever reason this older man who played video games better than I ever did intrigued me to look into his field of study to see what 'it' was. The further I looked into it the more cool it appeared to me, and the more interested I became in hearing background stories of other successful developers, to looking into qualifications for diving into the field myself. Not only could I get paid to stare at a computer screen for hours, but I could find a way to make my own programs or games one day. There was a language for pratically any type of software that I wanted to write, and nothing to hold me back but dedication. I would love to give you a straightforward, simple answer to this question; but at least with me - I don't think there is an easy way to describe it. The desire to dedicate yourself to a field of study has to be something you feel, the actual journey of it is something to describe. I feel on top of the world when I write a line of code that works, and when it doesn't work I actually am verily motivated to find out WHY. I want to become a Software Engineer because I want to wake up everyday to do something that feels personally meaningful and engaging to me and this is it. I honestly don't know why it feeling so fulfilling to me, but its enough for me to follow through with my head facing forward.
